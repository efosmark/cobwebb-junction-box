# Ham Radio Cobwebb Junction Box
KiCad EDA project for the Cobwebb Antenna Junction Box. Instructions for
constructing your own Cobwebb Antenna can be found here: http://test.g0mtd.co.uk/CB1.pdf

This version includes an RF choke on-board, from a T106-2 toroid, in order to
avoid needing the coaxial winding.
